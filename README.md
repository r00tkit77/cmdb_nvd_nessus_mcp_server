# CMDB-NVD MCP Server

A **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for vulnerability intelligence automation with Agentic AI. This system combines a Configuration Management Database (CMDB) with real-time CVE ingestion from NIST NVD and leverages **LLM-driven reasoning** for vulnerability correlation.

---

## Overview

This MCP server enables an AI agent (e.g., Claude Desktop) to:

* Query a **read-only CMDB** (asset inventory)
* Fetch recent **CVE data from NVD** via the official REST API
* Perform **LLM driven** co-relation between CVEs and assets in CMDB
* Generate and send **structured vulnerability reports** via email

---

## Work Flow

1. Load assets from CMDB
2. Fetch latest CVEs from NVD
3. Pre-process CVEs and assets
4. Perform correlation to determine potentially exposed assets
5. Generate structured vulnerability findings
6. Send report via email

## Available MCP Tools

| Tool                        | Description                                         | Example Prompt                                               |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `list_assets`               | View all CMDB assets (read-only)                    | "Show me all assets in my CMDB"                              |
| `get_assets_json`           | Retrieve assets as structured JSON for LLM analysis | "Get assets in JSON format"                                  |
| `get_cves_json`             | Retrieve CVEs as structured JSON for LLM analysis   | "Fetch CVEs in JSON format"                 |
| `fetch_latest_cves`         | Retrieve CVEs in human-readable format              | "Show latest CVEs of last 3 days with CVSS > 9"                                           |
| `send_vulnerability_report` | Send report based on LLM-generated findings         | "Send report to [user@example.com](mailto:user@example.com)" |

## Guardrails

### Security Guardrails

* **Read-only CMDB** – prevents asset modification 
* **Trusted data source** – CVEs fetched only from official NVD API
* **Restricted tool scope** – no arbitrary command execution
* **Secure configuration** – credentials managed via environment variables

---

### Operational Guardrails

* **CVE window limits** – capped query range (max 90 days)
* **Rate-limit aware fetching** – respects NVD API constraints
* **Bounded outputs** – prevents excessive token usage
* **Guided LLM reasoning** – enforces structured, version-aware decisions

---


## Limitations

### ❗ No Native Version Parser

* Version extraction relies on LLM interpretation of strings
* May struggle with non-standard version formats and missing version data


### ❗ Scalability Issue

* All CVEs and assets may be passed to LLM for co-relation
* Can lead to increased latency, higher token usage and reduced efficiency at scale


### ❗ LLM Dependency

* Accuracy depends on prompt quality and model capability
* May cause hallucinations


### ❗ No Automated Validation 

* No programmatic verification of LLM decisions
* Incorrect reasoning may pass through if not reviewed


### ❗ No Exploit Intelligence

* Does not consider active exploitation, public exploit availability and threat prioritization
